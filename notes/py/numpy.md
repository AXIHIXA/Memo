# `NumPy` Tutorial Notes

### ðŸŒ± SETTING UP

- Python library w/ homogeneous multidimensional array object `ndarray`, difference with bulit-in Python sequences: 
    - Fixed size at creation
        - Changing size will create a new array and delete the original
    - All elements be of the same data type, and thus same size
        - Exception: array of (Python, NumPy, ...) objects 
    - Faster operations
        - e.g. `c = a * b` in NumPy expands into precompiles index-based C loop
            - vectorization
            - boardcasting
    - Good eco-system

### ðŸŒ± QUICKSTART TUTORIAL

- Main object: homogeneous multidimensional array `numpy.ndarray`, alias `numpy.array`
    - table of elements (usually numbers)
    - all of the same type
    - indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers 
    - In NumPy, dimensions are called `axes`
- Attributes: 
    - `ndarray.ndim` 
        - the number of axes (dimensions) of the array.
    - `ndarray.shape` 
        - the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with n rows and m columns, shape will be `(n, m)`. The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, `ndim`.
    - `ndarray.size` 
        - the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape. 
    - `ndarray.dtype` 
        - an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtypeâ€™s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. `numpy.int32`, `numpy.int16`, and `numpy.float64` are some examples.
    - `ndarray.itemsize` 
        - the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type `float64` has `itemsize` 8 (=64/8), while one of type `complex32` has `itemsize` 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to `ndarray.dtype.itemsize`.
    - `ndarray.data` 
        - the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we wonâ€™t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.
- Array creation
    - `numpy.array` function
        - from regular Python list or tuple
            - must feed single sequence rather than multiple numeric arguments
        - type of resulting array is deduced from that of elements in sequence
            - type of the array can also be explicitly specified at creation time
        ```
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> a = np.array([2, 3, 4])
        >>> a
        array([2, 3, 4])
        >>> a.dtype
        dtype('int64')
        >>> b = np.array([1.2, 3.5, 5.1])
        >>> b.dtype
        dtype('float64')
        
        >>> c = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=complex)
        >>> c
        array([[ 1.+0.j, 2.+0.j],
        [ 3.+0.j, 4.+0.j]])
        ```
        - transform sequence of sequence into 2D arrays, sequence of sequence of sequence into 3D arrays, and so on
    - `numpy.zeros`, `numpy.ones`
        - create arrays with initial placeholder content
        - `dtype` by default is `float64`
    - `numpy.empty`
        - initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory
        - `dtype` by default is `float64`
