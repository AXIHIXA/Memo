# Professional CUDA C Programming Notes



## 🌱 1 Heterogeneous Parallel Computing with CUDA

### 🎯 PARALLEL COMPUTING

#### 📌 Computer Architecture

- *Flynn's Taxonomy*
  - Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)
    - Traditional computer
  - Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
    - Muliple cores
    - All cores execute the same instruction at any time
    - Each operate on different data stream
  - Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)
    - Uncommon
    - E.g., vector computers
  - Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)
- Objectives
  - Latency: Time take for an operaation to staart and complete
    - Time to complete an operation
    - microseconds
  - Bandwidth: Amount of data can be processed per unit time
    - MB/s, GB/s
  - Throughput: Amount of operations that can be processed per unit time
    - Number of operations processed in a given time unit
    - *gflops* (billion floating-point operaions per second)
- Memory organization
  - Multi-node with distributed memory
    - Many processers connected by a network
    - Each processor has its own local memory
    - Processers can communicate their local memories over the network
    - Referred as *clusters*
  - Multiprocesor with shared memory
    - Processors are 
      - either physically connected to the same memory
      - or share a low-latency link, e.g., PCI-Express (PCIe)
    - Same address space (there could be multiple physical memories)
- NVIDIA: *Single Instruction, Multiple Thread* (SIMT)

### 🎯 HETEROGENEOUS COMPUTING

- Performace features
  - *Peak computational performance* 
    - How many single-precision or double-precision floating point calculations can be processed per second
    - `gflops` (billion) or `tflops` (trillion)
  - *Memory bandwidth*
    - Ratio at which data could be read from or stored to memory
    - GB/s
- CPU Threads
  - Heavyweight
  - Context switches are slow and expensive
- GPU Threads
  - Lightweight
  - Thousands of threads queued up for work
