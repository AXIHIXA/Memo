# Professional CUDA C Programming Notes



## ðŸŒ± 1 Heterogeneous Parallel Computing with CUDA

### ðŸŽ¯ PARALLEL COMPUTING

#### ðŸ“Œ Computer Architecture

- Flynn's Taxonomy
  - Single Instruction Single Data (SISD)
    - Traditional computer
  - Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
    - Muliple cores
    - All cores execute the same instruction at any time
    - Each operate on different data stream
  - Multiple Instruction Single Data (MISD)
    - Uncommon
    - E.g., vector computers
  - Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD)
- Objectives
  - Latency: Time take for an operaation to staart and complete
    - Time to complete an operation
    - microseconds
  - Bandwidth: Amount of data can be processed per unit time
    - MB/s, GB/s
  - Throughput: Amount of operations that can be processed per unit time
    - Number of operations processed in a given time unit
    - *gflops* (billion floating-point operaions per second)
- Memory organization
  - Multi-node with distributed memory
  - Multiprocesor with shared memory
