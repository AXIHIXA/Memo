### ðŸŒ± [Part I. RAII and Memory Management](https://theboostcpplibraries.com/raii-and-memory-management)

- RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization. 
    - For any resource acquired, an object should be initialized that will own that resource and close it in the destructor. 
    - *Smart pointers* are a prominent example of RAII. They help avoid memory leaks. 
- `Boost.SmartPointers` defines smart pointers. 
    - Some of them are provided by the C++11 standard library. 
    - Others are only available in Boost.
- `Boost.PointerContainer` defines containers to store dynamically allocated objects: objects that are created with new. 
    - Because the containers from this library destroy objects with delete in the destructor, no smart pointers need to be used.
- `Boost.ScopeExit` makes it possible to use the RAII idiom for any resources. 
    - While `Boost.SmartPointers` and `Boost.PointerContainer` can only be used with pointers to dynamically allocated objects, with `Boost.ScopeExit` no resource-specific classes need to be used. 
- `Boost.Pool` has nothing to do with RAII, but it has a lot to do with memory management. This library defines numerous classes to provide memory to your program faster.
