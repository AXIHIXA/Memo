## ðŸŒ± Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs

### ðŸ“Œ Item 2: Prefer `const`s, `enum`s, and `inline`s to `#define`s
    
- For simple constants, prefer `const` objects or `enum`s to `#define`s.
- For function-like macros, prefer `inline` functions to `#define`s.

#### The `enum` hack

For class-specific constants, use `enum`s instead of `static const` data members 
```
// GamePlayer.h
class GamePlayer 
{
private: 
    static const int NumTurns = 5;   // constant declaration & in-class initialization
    int scores[NumTurns];            // use of constant
};

// GamePlayer.cpp
const int GamePlayer::NumTurns;      // definition of NumTurns; see below for why no value is given
```
Usually, C++ requires that you provide a definition for anything you use, 
but class-specific constants that are `static` and of integral type 
(e.g., `int`s, `char`s, `bool`s) are an *exception*. 
As long as you don't *take their address*, 
you can declare them and use them without ~~providing a definition~~. 
If you do take the address of a class constant, 
or if your compiler incorrectly insists on a definition even if you don't take the address, 
you provide a separate definition in implementation file. 
<br><br>
Older compilers may not accept the syntax above, 
because it used to be ~~illegal to provide an initial value for a static class member at its point of declaration~~. 
Furthermore, in-class initialization is allowed only for *integral types* and only for *constants*. 
In cases where the above syntax can't be used, you put the initial value at the point of definition: 
```
// CostEstimate.h
class CostEstimate 
{
private:
    static const double FudgeFactor;            // declaration of static class constant
};

// CostEstimate.cpp
const double CostEstimate::FudgeFactor = 1.35;  // definition of static classconstant
```
The above block of code is all you need almost all the time. 
The only exception is when you *need the value of a class constant during compilation* of the class, 
such as in the declaration of the array `GamePlayer::scores` above 
(where compilers insist on knowing the size of the array during compilation). 
Then the accepted way to compensate for compilers that (incorrectly) forbid 
the in-class specification of initial values for static integral class constants 
is to use what is affectionately (and non-pejoratively) known as the `enum` hack. 
This technique takes advantage of the fact that the values of an enumerated type can be used where ints are expected, 
so `GamePlayer` could just as well be defined like this:
```
class GamePlayer 
{
private:
    enum {NumTurns = 5};   // "the enum hack" makes NumTurns a symbolic name for 5
    int scores[NumTurns];  // fine
};
```
The `enum` hack is worth knowing about for several reasons. 
- *Access Constraints*. <br>
  The `enum` hack behaves in some ways more like a `#define` than a `const` does, 
  and sometimes that's what you want. 
  For example, it's legal to take the address of a `const`, 
  but it's **not legal** to take the address of an `enum`, 
  and it's typically **not legal** to take the address of a `#define`, either. 
  If you don't want to let people get a pointer or reference to one of your integral constants, 
  an enum is a good way to enforce that constraint. 
- *Memory Allocation*. <br>
  Though good compilers won't set aside storage for const objects of integral types 
  (unless you create a pointer or reference to the object), 
  sloppy compilers may, and you may not be willing to set aside memory for such objects. 
  Like `#define`s, `enum`s never result in that kind of unnecessary memory allocation.
- *Pragmatic*. <br>
  Lots of code employs it, so you need to recognize it when you see it. 
  In fact, the `enum` hack is a fundamental technique of template metaprogramming. 

#### Common (mis)use of `#define` directives

Using it to implement macros that look like functions but that don't incur the overhead of a function call
```
// call f with the maximum of a and b
// even if everything is properly parenthesised, there can still be problems! 
#define CALL_WITH_MAX(a, b) f((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

int a = 5, b = 0;
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b);       // a is incremented twice
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b + 10);  // a is incremented once
```
You can get all the efficiency of a macro plus all the predictable behavior and type safety 
of a regular function by using a `template` for an `inline` function: 
```
// because we don't know what T is, we pass by reference-to-const
template <typename T> 
inline void callWithMax(const T & a, const T & b) 
{ 
    f(a > b ? a : b);
}
```
This template generates a whole family of functions, 
each of which takes two objects of the same type and calls `f` with the greater of the two objects. 
There's no need to parenthesize parameters inside the function body, 
no need to worry about evaluating parameters multiple times, etc. 
Furthermore, because callWithMax is a real function, it obeys scope and access rules. 
For example, it makes perfect sense to talk about an inline function that is private to a class. 
In general, there's just no way to do that with a macro.

### ðŸ“Œ Item 3: Use `const` whenever possible

- Declaring something `const` helps compilers detect usage errors. 
  `const` can be applied to objects at any scope, 
  to function parameters and return types, 
  and to member functions as a whole.
- Compilers enforce bitwise constness, 
  but you should program using logical constness.
- When `const` and non-`const` member functions have essentially identical implementations, 
  code duplication can be avoided by having the non-`const` version call the `const` version. 

#### `const` iterators

*STL iterators are modeled on pointers*, so an iterator acts much like a `T *` pointer. 
Declaring an iterator `const` is like declaring a pointer `const` (i.e., declaring a `T * const` pointer): 
the iterator isn't allowed to point to something different, but the thing it points to may be modified. 
If you want an iterator that points to something that can't be modified 
(i.e., the STL analogue of a `const T *` pointer), you want a `const_iterator`:
```
std::vector<int> vec {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

const std::vector<int>::iterator iter = vec.begin();    // iter acts like a T * const
*iter = 10;                                             // OK, changes what iter points to
++iter;                                                 // error! iter is const

std::vector<int>::const_iterator cIter = vec.cbegin();  // cIter acts like a const T*
*cIter = 10;                                            // error! *cIter is const
++cIter;                                                // fine, changescIter
```

#### **`const`s in function return values

Having a function return a constant value often makes it possible to 
reduce the incidence of client errors without giving up safety or efficiency: 
```
class Rational { ... };
const Rational operator*(const Rational & lhs, const Rational & rhs);
```
Many programmers squint when they first see this. 
Why should the result of `operator*` be a `const` object? 
Because if it weren't, clients would be able to commit atrocities like this:
```
Rational a, b, c;
(a * b) = c;       // invoke operator= on the result of (a * b)!
```
I don't know why any programmer would want to make an assignment to the product of two numbers, 
but I do know that many programmers have tried to do it without wanting to. 
All it takes is a simple typo (and a type that can be implicitly converted to `bool`):
```
if (a * b = c)     // oops, meant to do a comparison!
{
    // ...
}
```
Such code would be flat-out illegal if `a` and `b` were of a built-in type. 
One of the hallmarks of good user-defined types is that they avoid gratuitous incompatibilities with the built-ins, 
and allowing assignments to the product of two numbers seems pretty gratuitous to me. 
Declaring `operator*`'s return value `const` prevents it, and that's why it's The Right Thing To Do. 

#### `const` member functions

Many people overlook the fact that *member functions differing only in their constness can be overloaded*, but this is an important feature of C++. 
Incidentally, const objects most often arise in real programs as a result of being passed by pointer-to-const or reference-to-const.
What does it mean for a member function to be const? 
There are two prevailing notions: 
- *bitwise constness* (also known as *physical constness*) 
    The bitwise `const` camp believes that a member function is `const`
    iff. it doesn't modify any of the object's data members (excluding those that are `static`), 
    i.e., iff. it *doesn't modify any of the bits inside the object*. 
    The nice thing about bitwise constness is that it's easy to detect violations: 
    compilers just look for assignments to data members. 
    In fact, bitwise constness is C++'s definition of constness, 
    and a `const` member function isn't allowed to modify 
    any of the non-`static` data members of the object on which it is invoked. 
    <br><br>
    Unfortunately, many member functions that don't act very `const` pass the bitwise test. 
    In particular, *a member function that modifies what a pointer points* to frequently doesn't act `const`. 
    But if only the pointer is in the object, the function is bitwise `const`, and compilers won't complain. 
    That can lead to counterintuitive behavior. 
    For example, suppose we have a `TextBlock`-like class that stores its data as a `char *` instead of a `string`, 
    because it needs to communicate through a C API that doesn't understand `string` objects. 
    ```
    class CTextBlock 
    {
    public:
        // inappropriate (but bitwise const) declaration of operator[]
        char & operator[](std::size_t position) const 
        { 
            return pText[position]; 
        } 
        
    private:
        char * pText;
    };
    ```
    This class (inappropriately) declares `operator[]` as a `const` member function,
    even though that function returns a reference to the object's internal data. 
    Set that aside and note that `operator[]`'s implementation doesn't modify `pText` in any way. 
    As a result, compilers will happily generate code for `operator[]`; 
    it is, after all, bitwise `const`, and that's all compilers check for. 
    But look what it allows to happen:
    ```
    const CTextBlock cctb("Hello");  // declare constant object
    char *pc = &cctb[0];             // call the const operator[] to get a  pointer to cctb's data
    *pc = 'J';                       // cctb now has the value "Jello"
    ```
- *logical constness* <br>
    A `const` member function *might modify some of the bits in the object* on which it's invoked, 
    but *only in ways that clients cannot detect*. 
    For example, your `CTextBlock` class might want to cache the length of the textblock whenever it's requested:
    ```
    class CTextBlock 
    {
    public:
        std::size_t length() const;
        
    private:
        char * pText;
        std::size_t textLength;               // last calculated length of textblock
        bool lengthIsValid;                   // whether length is currently valid
    };
    
    std::size_t CTextBlock::length() const
    {
        if (!lengthIsValid) 
        {
            textLength = std::strlen(pText);  // error! can't assign to textLength and lengthIsValid in a const member function
            lengthIsValid = true;
        } 
        
        return textLength;
    }
    ```
    The solution is simple: take advantage of C++'s `const`-related wiggle room known as `mutable`. 
    `mutable` frees non-`static` data members from the constraints of bitwise constness: 
    ```
    class CTextBlock 
    {
    public:
        std::size_t length() const;
        
    private:
        char * pText;
        mutable std::size_t textLength;       // last calculated length of textblock
        mutable bool lengthIsValid;           // whether length is currently valid
    };
    
    std::size_t CTextBlock::length() const
    {
        if (!lengthIsValid) 
        {
            textLength = std::strlen(pText);  // can modify mutables in a const member function
            lengthIsValid = true;
        } 
        
        return textLength;
    }
    ```

#### Avoiding Duplication in `const` and Non-`const` Member Functions

```
class TextBlock 
{
public:
    const char & operator[](std::size_t position) const  // same as before
    {
        // do a lot of stuff here...
        return text[position];
    }
    
    char & operator[](std::size_t position)              // now just calls const op[]
    {
        // 1. add const to (*this)'s type;
        // 2. call const version of op[];
        // 3. cast away const on op[]'s return type. 
        return const_cast<char &>(static_cast<const TextBlock &>(*this)[position]);
    }
};
```
To avoid infinite recursion, 
we have to specify that we want to call the `const` `operator[]`, 
but there's no direct way to do that. 
Instead, we cast `*this` from its native type of `TextBlock &` to `const TextBlock &`.
Yes, we use a cast to add const! So we have two casts: 
one to add const to `*this` (so that our call to `operator[]` will call the `const` version), 
the second to remove the `const` from the `const` `operator[]`'s return value. 
The cast that adds `const` is just forcing a safe conversion 
(from a non-`const` object to a `const` one), 
so we use a `static_cast` for that. 
The one that removes `const` can be accomplished only via a `const_cast`, 
so we don't really have a choice there. 
<br><br>
Even more worth knowing is that trying to do things the other way around 
(avoiding duplication by ~~having the `const` version call the non-`const` version~~)
is **not** something you want to do. 
Remember, a `const` member function promises never to change the logical state of its object, 
but a non-`const` member function makes no such promise. 
If you were to call a non-`const` function from a `const` one, 
you'd run the risk that the object you'd promised not to modify would be changed. 
That's why having a `const` member function call a non-`const` one is wrong: 
the object could be changed. 
In fact, to get the code to compile, you'd have to use a `const_cast` to get rid of the `const` on `*this`,
a clear sign of trouble. 
The reverse calling sequence (the one we used above) is safe: 
the non-`const` member function can do whatever it wants with an object, 
so calling a `const` member function imposes no risk. <br>
That's why a `static_cast` works on `*this` in that case: there's no `const`-related danger. 

### ðŸ“Œ Item 4: Make sure that objects are initialized before they're used

- **Always initialize your objects before you use them** <br>
    For non-member objects of built-in types, you'll need to do this manually: 
    ```
    int x = 0;                               // manual initialization of an int
    const char * text = "A C-style string";  // manual initialization of a pointer
    double d;                                // "initialization" by reading from an input stream
    std::cin >> d; 
    ```
    For almost everything else, the responsibility for initialization falls on constructors. 
    The rule there is simple: make sure that *all constructors initialize everything in the object*. 
    - ***Not** to confuse assignment with initialization**. <br>
        Consider a constructor for a class representing entries in an address book:
        ```
        class PhoneNumber 
        { 
            // ... 
        };
        
        class ABEntry  // Address Book Entry
        {
        public:
            ABEntry(const std::string & name, 
                    const std::string & address, 
                    const std::list<PhoneNumber> & phones)
            {
                // these are all assignments, not initializations
                theName = name; 
                theAddress = address; 
                thePhones = phones;
                numTimesConsulted = 0;
            }
        
        private:
            std::string theName;
            std::string theAddress;
            std::list<PhoneNumber> thePhones;
            int num TimesConsulted;
        };
        ```
        This will yield `ABEntry` objects with the values you expect, but it's still not the best approach. 
        The rules of C++ stipulate that data members of an object are initialized *before* the body of a constructor is entered. 
        Inside the `ABEntry` constructor, `theName`, `theAddress`, and `thePhones` **aren't** being initialized, they're being *assigned*. 
        Initialization took place earlier: when their default constructors were automatically called prior to entering the body of the `ABEntry` constructor. 
        This isn't true for `numTimesConsulted`, because it's a built-in type. 
        For it, there's **no** guarantee it was initialized at all prior to its assignment.
    - *Member initialization list* <br>
        ```
        ABEntry::ABEntry(const std::string & name, 
                         const std::string & address, 
                         const std::list<PhoneNumber> & phones)
                : theName(name), 
                  theAddress(address), 
                  thePhones(phones), 
                  numTimesConsulted(0)
        {
            // the ctor body is now empty
        }
        ```
        This constructor yields the same end result as the one above, but it will often be more efficient. 
        There's no need to do default initialization for class-type objects 
        like `theName`, `theAddress`, and `thePhones` before entering the constructor body. 
        For objects of built-in type like `numTimesConsulted`, 
        there is no difference in cost between initialization and assignment, 
        but for consistency, it's often best to initialize everything via member initialization.
        <br><br>
        Similarly, you can use the member initialization list even when you want to default-construct a data member; 
        just specify nothing as an initialization argument. 
        For example, if `ABEntry` had a constructor taking no parameters, it could be implemented like this:
        ```
        ABEntry::ABEntry()
                : theName(),            // call theName's default ctor;
                  theAddress(),         // do the same for theAddress;
                  thePhones(),          // and for thePhones;
                  numTimesConsulted(0)  // but explicitly initialize numTimesConsulted to zero
        {
        
        } 
        ```

### ðŸ“Œ Item 1: Understand template type deduction

- During template type deduction, arguments that are references are treated as non-references, i.e., their reference-ness is ignored.
- When deducing types for universal reference parameters, lvalue arguments get special treatment.
- When deducing types for by-value parameters, const and/or volatile arguments are treated as non-const and non-volatile.
- During template type deduction, arguments that are array or function names decay to pointers, unless theyâ€™re used to initialize references.

If youâ€™re willing to overlook a pinch of pseudocode, we can think of a function template as looking like this:
```
template <typename T>
void f(ParamType param);

f(expr);  // call f with some expression
```
During compilation, compilers use expr to deduce two types: one for `T` and one for `ParamType`. 
These types are frequently **different**, because `ParamType` often contains adornments, e.g., `const` or reference qualifiers. 
E.g., for the following case, `T` is deduced to be `int`, but `ParamType` is deduced to be `const int &`. 
```
template <typename T>
void f(const T & param);  // ParamType is const T &

int x = 0;
f(x);                     // call f with an int
```
The type deduced for `T` is **not** always the same as the type of the argument passed to the function, i.e., that `T` is the type of `expr`. 
Because the type deduced for `T` is dependent not just on the type of `expr`, but also on the form of `ParamType`. 
There are three cases: 
- `ParamType` is a *pointer* or *non-universal reference* type 
    - Universal references are described in Item 24. 
      At this point, all you need to know is that they exist 
      and that theyâ€™re not the same as lvalue references or rvalue references. 
    - Workflow: 
        - If `expr`â€™s type is a reference, ignore the reference part.
        - Then pattern-match `expr`â€™s type against `ParamType` to determine `T`. 
    - For example: 
    ```
    template <typename T>
    void f(T & param);     // param is a reference

    int x = 27;            // x is an int
    const int cx = x;      // cx is a const int
    const int & rx = x;    // rx is a reference to x as a const int
    ```
    The deduced types for `param` and `T` in various calls are as follows:
    ```
    f(x);                  // T is       int, param's type is int &
    f(cx);                 // T is const int, param's type is const int &
    f(rx);                 // T is const int, param's type is const int &
    ```
    Passing a const object to a template taking a `T &` parameter is safe:
    the constness of the object becomes part of the type deduced for `T`. 
    <br><br>
    These examples all show *lvalue reference* parameters, but type deduction works exactly the same way for *rvalue reference* parameters. 
    Of course, only rvalue arguments may be passed to rvalue reference parameters, but that restriction has nothing to do with type deduction. 
    <br><br>
    If we change the type of `f`â€™s parameter from `T &` to `const T &`, 
    things change a little, but not in any really surprising ways. 
    The constness of `cx` and `rx` continues to be respected,
    but because weâ€™re now assuming that `param` is a reference-to-const, 
    thereâ€™s no longer a need for `const` to be deduced as part of `T`:
    ```
    template <typename T>
    void f(const T & param);  // param is now a ref-to-const
    
    int x = 27;               // as before
    const int cx = x;         // as before
    const int& rx = x;        // as before
    
    f(x);                     // T is int, param's type is const int &
    f(cx);                    // T is int, param's type is const int &
    f(rx);                    // T is int, param's type is const int &
    ```
    If `param` were a pointer (or a pointer to const) instead of a reference, things would work essentially the same way: 
    ```
    template <typename T>
    void f(T * param);        // param is now a pointer
    
    int x = 27;               // as before
    const int * px = &x;      // px is a ptr to x as a const int
    
    f(&x);                    // T is       int, param's type is int *
    f(px);                    // T is const int, param's type is const int *
    ```
    By now, you may find yourself yawning and nodding off, 
    because C++â€™s type deduction rules work so naturally for reference and pointer parameters, 
    seeing them in written form is really dull. 
    Everythingâ€™s just obvious! 
    *Which is exactly what you want in a type deduction system*. 
- `ParamType` is a *universal reference* <br>
    Such parameters are declared like rvalue references 
    (i.e., in a function template taking a type parameter `T`, a universal referenceâ€™s declared type is `T &&`), 
    but they behave differently when lvalue arguments are passed in. 
    The complete story is told in Item 24, but hereâ€™s the headline version: 
    - If `expr` is an *lvalue*, both `T` and `ParamType` are deduced (*collapse*) to be *lvalue references*; 
    - If `expr` is an *rvalue*, the normal (i.e., Case 1) rules apply.
    - For example:
    ```
    template <typename T>
    void f(T && param);    // param is now a universal reference
    
    int x = 27;            // as before
    const int cx = x;      // as before
    const int & rx = x;    // as before
    
    f(x);                  //  x is lvalue, so T is       int &, param's type is       int &
    f(cx);                 // cx is lvalue, so T is const int &, param's type is const int &
    f(rx);                 // rx is lvalue, so T is const int &, param's type is const int &
    f(27);                 // 27 is rvalue, so T is       int  , param's type is       int &&
    ```
- `ParamType` is neither a ~~pointer~~ nor a ~~reference~~ <br>
    Weâ€™re dealing with pass-by-value:
    ```
    template<typename T>
    void f(T param);       // param is now passed by value
    ```
    That means that `param` will be a *copy* of whatever is passed in: a completely new object. 
    The fact that `param` will be a new object motivates the rules that govern how `T` is deduced from `expr`:
    - Remove reference-ness and top-level cv-constraints (top-level const-ness and/or volatile-ness)
        - `volatile` objects are uncommon. Theyâ€™re generally used only for implementing device drivers. For details, see Item 40.
        - This is because reference-ness and top-level cv-constraints are **ignored** during parameter type deduction.
    - For example: 
    ```
    int x = 27;            // as before
    const int cx = x;      // as before
    const int & rx = x;    // as before
    
    f(x);                  // T's and param's types are both int
    f(cx);                 // T's and param's types are again both int
    f(rx);                 // T's and param's types are still both int
    ```
    Note that even though `cx` and `rx` represent `const` values, param isnâ€™t `const`. 
    That makes sense. 
    `param` is an object thatâ€™s completely independent of `cx` and `rx`: a copy of `cx` or `rx`. 
    The fact that `cx` and `rx` canâ€™t be modified says nothing about whether `param` can be. 
    Thatâ€™s why `expr`â€™s const-ness (and volatile-ness, if any) is ignored when deducing a type for `param`: 
    just because `expr` canâ€™t be modified doesnâ€™t mean that a copy of it canâ€™t be. 
    <br><br>
    Itâ€™s important to recognize that only *top-level cv-constraints* are ignored. 
    *Low-level cv-constraints* are preserved properly. 
    That is,  `const` (and `volatile`) is ignored only for by-value parameters. 
    As weâ€™ve seen, for parameters that are references-to-const or pointers-to-const, 
    the constness of `expr` is preserved during type deduction.  
    Consider the case where `expr` is a `const` pointer to a `const` object, and `expr` is passed to a by-value `param`: 
    ```
    template <typename T>
    void f(T param);                               // param is still passed by value
    
    const char * const ptr = "Fun with pointers";  // ptr is const pointer to const object
    f(ptr);                                        // pass arg of type const char * const
    ```
    In this case, `T` is deducted to `const char *`.

#### Array Arguments

In many contexts, an array decays into a pointer to its first element. 
This decay is what permits code like this to compile:
```
const char name[] = "J. P. Briggs";  // name's type is const char[13]
const char * ptrToName = name;       // array decays to pointer
```
Here, the `const char *` pointer `ptrToName` is being initialized with `name`, which is a `const char[13]`. 
These types (`const char *` and `const char[13]`) are **not** the same, but because of the array-to-pointer decay rule, the code compiles. 
<br><br>
But what if an array is passed to a template taking a by-value parameter? What happens then?
```
template <typename T>
void f(T param);                     // template with by-value parameter

f(name);                             // what types are deduced for T and param?
```
We begin with the observation that there is no such thing as a function parameter thatâ€™s an array. 
In parameter lists, an array declaration is treated as a pointer declaration: 
```
void myFunc(int param[]);
void myFunc(int * param);            // same function as above
```
Because array parameter declarations are treated as if they were pointer parameters,
the type of an array thatâ€™s passed to a template function by value is deduced to be a pointer type. 
That means that in the call to the template `f`, its type parameter `T` is deduced to be `const char *`. 
<br><br>
But now comes a curve ball. 
Although functions canâ€™t declare parameters that are truly arrays, 
they can declare parameters that are *references to arrays*! 
So if we modify the template `f` to take its argument by reference, 
```
template <typename T>
void f(T & param);                   // template with by-reference parameter

f(name);                             // what types are deduced for T and param?
```
the type deduced for `T` is the *actual type of the array*! 
That type includes the size of the array, so in this example, 
`T` is deduced to be `const char [13]`, 
and the type of `f`â€™s parameter (a reference to this array) is `const char (&)[13]`. 
<br><br>
Interestingly, the ability to declare references to arrays enables creation of a template
that deduces the number of elements that an array contains:
```
// return size of an array as a compile-time constant. 
// (The array parameter has no name, 
// because we care only about the number of elements it contains.)
template <typename T, std::size_t N> 
constexpr std::size_t arraySize(T (&)[N]) noexcept
{
    return N;
}
```
As Item 15 explains, declaring this function `constexpr` makes its result available during compilation. 
That makes it possible to declare, say, an array 
with the same number of elements as a second array whose size is computed from a *braced initializer*: 
```
int keyVals[] = {1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 35};        // keyVals has 7 elements
int mappedVals[arraySize(keyVals)];              // so does mappedVals
```
Of course, as a modern C++ developer, youâ€™d naturally prefer a `std::array` to a built-in array:
```
std::array<int, arraySize(keyVals)> mappedVals;  // mappedVals' size is 7
```
As for `arraySize` being declared `noexcept`, thatâ€™s to help compilers generate better code. For details, see Item 14. 

#### Function Arguments

Function types can decay into function pointers, 
and everything weâ€™ve discussed regarding type deduction for arrays 
applies to type deduction for functions and their decay into function pointers. 
As a result:
```
void someFunc(int, double);  // someFunc is a function; type is void(int, double)

template <typename T>
void f1(T param);            // in f1, param passed by value

template<typename T>
void f2(T & param);          // in f2, param passed by ref

f1(someFunc);                // param deduced as ptr-to-func; type is void (*)(int, double)
f2(someFunc);                // param deduced as ref-to-func; type is void (&)(int, double)
```
