## ðŸŒ± Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs

### ðŸ“Œ Item 2: Prefer `const`s, `enum`s, and `inline`s to `#define`s
    
- For simple constants, prefer `const` objects or `enum`s to `#define`s.
- For function-like macros, prefer `inline` functions to `#define`s.

#### The `enum` hack

For class-specific constants, use `enum`s instead of `static const` data members 
```
// GamePlayer.h
class GamePlayer 
{
private: 
    static const int NumTurns = 5;   // constant declaration & in-class initialization
    int scores[NumTurns];            // use of constant
};

// GamePlayer.cpp
const int GamePlayer::NumTurns;      // definition of NumTurns; see below for why no value is given
```
Usually, C++ requires that you provide a definition for anything you use, 
but class-specific constants that are `static` and of integral type 
(e.g., `int`s, `char`s, `bool`s) are an *exception*. 
As long as you don't *take their address*, 
you can declare them and use them without ~~providing a definition~~. 
If you do take the address of a class constant, 
or if your compiler incorrectly insists on a definition even if you don't take the address, 
you provide a separate definition in implementation file. 
<br><br>
Older compilers may not accept the syntax above, 
because it used to be ~~illegal to provide an initial value for a static class member at its point of declaration~~. 
Furthermore, in-class initialization is allowed only for *integral types* and only for *constants*. 
In cases where the above syntax can't be used, you put the initial value at the point of definition: 
```
// CostEstimate.h
class CostEstimate 
{
private:
    static const double FudgeFactor;            // declaration of static class constant
};

// CostEstimate.cpp
const double CostEstimate::FudgeFactor = 1.35;  // definition of static classconstant
```
The above block of code is all you need almost all the time. 
The only exception is when you *need the value of a class constant during compilation* of the class, 
such as in the declaration of the array `GamePlayer::scores` above 
(where compilers insist on knowing the size of the array during compilation). 
Then the accepted way to compensate for compilers that (incorrectly) forbid 
the in-class specification of initial values for static integral class constants 
is to use what is affectionately (and non-pejoratively) known as the `enum` hack. 
This technique takes advantage of the fact that the values of an enumerated type can be used where ints are expected, 
so `GamePlayer` could just as well be defined like this:
```
class GamePlayer 
{
private:
    enum {NumTurns = 5};   // "the enum hack" makes NumTurns a symbolic name for 5
    int scores[NumTurns];  // fine
};
```
The `enum` hack is worth knowing about for several reasons. 
- *Access Constraints*. <br>
  The `enum` hack behaves in some ways more like a `#define` than a `const` does, 
  and sometimes that's what you want. 
  For example, it's legal to take the address of a `const`, 
  but it's **not legal** to take the address of an `enum`, 
  and it's typically **not legal** to take the address of a `#define`, either. 
  If you don't want to let people get a pointer or reference to one of your integral constants, 
  an enum is a good way to enforce that constraint. 
- *Memory Allocation*. <br>
  Though good compilers won't set aside storage for `const` objects of integral types 
  (unless you create a pointer or reference to the object), 
  sloppy compilers may, and you may not be willing to set aside memory for such objects. 
  Like `#define`s, `enum`s never result in that kind of unnecessary memory allocation.
- *Pragmatic*. <br>
  Lots of code employs it, so you need to recognize it when you see it. 
  In fact, the `enum` hack is a fundamental technique of template metaprogramming. 

#### Common (mis)use of `#define` directives

Using it to implement macros that look like functions but that don't incur the overhead of a function call
```
// call f with the maximum of a and b
// even if everything is properly parenthesised, there can still be problems! 
#define CALL_WITH_MAX(a, b) f((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

int a = 5, b = 0;
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b);       // a is incremented twice
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b + 10);  // a is incremented once
```
You can get all the efficiency of a macro plus all the predictable behavior and type safety 
of a regular function by using a `template` for an `inline` function: 
```
// because we don't know what T is, we pass by reference-to-const
template <typename T> 
inline void callWithMax(const T & a, const T & b) 
{ 
    f(a > b ? a : b);
}
```
This template generates a whole family of functions, 
each of which takes two objects of the same type and calls `f` with the greater of the two objects. 
There's no need to parenthesize parameters inside the function body, 
no need to worry about evaluating parameters multiple times, etc. 
Furthermore, because callWithMax is a real function, it obeys scope and access rules. 
For example, it makes perfect sense to talk about an inline function that is private to a class. 
In general, there's just no way to do that with a macro.

### ðŸ“Œ Item 3: Use `const` whenever possible

- Declaring something `const` helps compilers detect usage errors. 
  `const` can be applied to objects at any scope, 
  to function parameters and return types, 
  and to member functions as a whole.
- Compilers enforce bitwise constness, 
  but you should program using logical constness.
- When `const` and non-`const` member functions have essentially identical implementations, 
  code duplication can be avoided by having the non-`const` version call the `const` version. 

#### `const` iterators

*STL iterators are modeled on pointers*, so an iterator acts much like a `T *` pointer. 
Declaring an iterator `const` is like declaring a pointer const (i.e., declaring a `T * const` pointer): 
the iterator isn't allowed to point to something different, but the thing it points to may be modified. 
If you want an iterator that points to something that can't be modified 
(i.e., the STL analogue of a `const T *` pointer), you want a `const_iterator`:
```
std::vector<int> vec {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

const std::vector<int>::iterator iter = vec.begin();    // iter acts like a T * const
*iter = 10;                                             // OK, changes what iter points to
++iter;                                                 // error! iter is const

std::vector<int>::const_iterator cIter = vec.cbegin();  // cIter acts like a const T*
*cIter = 10;                                            // error! *cIter is const
++cIter;                                                // fine, changescIter
```

#### **`const`s in function return values

Having a function return a constant value often makes it possible to 
reduce the incidence of client errors without giving up safety or efficiency: 
```
class Rational { ... };
const Rational operator*(const Rational & lhs, const Rational & rhs);
```
Many programmers squint when they first see this. <br>
Why should the result of `operator*` be a `const` object? <br>
Because if it weren't, clients would be able to commit atrocities like this:
```
Rational a, b, c;
(a * b) = c;       // invoke operator= on the result of (a * b)!
```
I don't know why any programmer would want to make an assignment to the product of two numbers, 
but I do know that many programmers have tried to do it without wanting to. <br>
All it takes is a simple typo (and a type that can be implicitly converted to `bool`):
```
if (a * b = c)     // oops, meant to do a comparison!
{
    // ...
}
```
Such code would be flat-out illegal if `a` and `b` were of a built-in type. <br>
One of the hallmarks of good user-defined types is that they avoid gratuitous incompatibilities with the built-ins, 
and allowing assignments to the product of two numbers seems pretty gratuitous to me. <br>
Declaring `operator*`'s return value `const` prevents it, and that's why it's The Right Thing To Do. 

#### `const` member functions

Many people overlook the fact that *member functions differing only in their constness can be overloaded*, but this is an important feature of C++. <br>
Incidentally, const objects most often arise in real programs as a result of being passed by pointer-to-const or reference-to-const.
What does it mean for a member function to be const? <br>
There are two prevailing notions: 
- *bitwise constness* (also known as *physical constness*) <br>
    The bitwise `const` camp believes that a member function is `const`
    iff. it doesn't modify any of the object's data members (excluding those that are `static`), 
    i.e., iff. it *doesn't modify any of the bits inside the object*. <br>
    The nice thing about bitwise constness is that it's easy to detect violations: 
    compilers just look for assignments to data members. <br>
    In fact, bitwise constness is C++'s definition of constness, 
    and a `const` member function isn't allowed to modify 
    any of the non-`static` data members of the object on which it is invoked. <br><br>
    Unfortunately, many member functions that don't act very `const` pass the bitwise test. <br>
    In particular, *a member function that modifies what a pointer points* to frequently doesn't act `const`. <br>
    But if only the pointer is in the object, the function is bitwise `const`, and compilers won't complain. <br>
    That can lead to counterintuitive behavior. <br>
    For example, suppose we have a `TextBlock`-like class that stores its data as a `char *` instead of a `string`, 
    because it needs to communicate through a C API that doesn't understand `string` objects. <br>
    ```
    class CTextBlock 
    {
    public:
        // inappropriate (but bitwise const) declaration of operator[]
        char & operator[](std::size_t position) const 
        { 
            return pText[position]; 
        } 
        
    private:
        char * pText;
    };
    ```
    This class (inappropriately) declares `operator[]` as a `const` member function,
    even though that function returns a reference to the object's internal data. <br>
    Set that aside and note that `operator[]`'s implementation doesn't modify `pText` in any way. <br>
    As a result, compilers will happily generate code for `operator[]`; 
    it is, after all, bitwise `const`, and that's all compilers check for. <br>
    But look what it allows to happen:
    ```
    const CTextBlock cctb("Hello");  // declare constant object
    char *pc = &cctb[0];             // call the const operator[] to get a  pointer to cctb's data
    *pc = 'J';                       // cctb now has the value "Jello"
    ```
- *logical constness* <br>
    A `const` member function *might modify some of the bits in the object* on which it's invoked, 
    but *only in ways that clients cannot detect*. <br>
    For example, your `CTextBlock` class might want to cache the length of the textblock whenever it's requested:
    ```
    class CTextBlock 
    {
    public:
        std::size_t length() const;
        
    private:
        char * pText;
        std::size_t textLength;               // last calculated length of textblock
        bool lengthIsValid;                   // whether length is currently valid
    };
    
    std::size_t CTextBlock::length() const
    {
        if (!lengthIsValid) 
        {
            textLength = std::strlen(pText);  // error! can't assign to textLength and lengthIsValid in a const member function
            lengthIsValid = true;
        } 
        
        return textLength;
    }
    ```
    The solution is simple: take advantage of C++'s `const`-related wiggle room known as `mutable`. 
    `mutable` frees non-`static` data members from the constraints of bitwise constness: 
    ```
    class CTextBlock 
    {
    public:
        std::size_t length() const;
        
    private:
        char * pText;
        mutable std::size_t textLength;       // last calculated length of textblock
        mutable bool lengthIsValid;           // whether length is currently valid
    };
    
    std::size_t CTextBlock::length() const
    {
        if (!lengthIsValid) 
        {
            textLength = std::strlen(pText);  // can modify mutables in a const member function
            lengthIsValid = true;
        } 
        
        return textLength;
    }
    ```

#### Avoiding Duplication in `const` and Non-`const` Member Functions

```
class TextBlock 
{
public:
    const char & operator[](std::size_t position) const  // same as before
    {
        // do a lot of stuff here...
        return text[position];
    }
    
    char & operator[](std::size_t position)              // now just calls const op[]
    {
        // 1. add const to (*this)'s type;
        // 2. call const version of op[];
        // 3. cast away const on op[]'s return type. 
        return const_cast<char &>(static_cast<const TextBlock &>(*this)[position]);
    }
};
```
To avoid infinite recursion, 
we have to specify that we want to call the `const` `operator[]`, 
but there's no direct way to do that. 
Instead, we cast `*this` from its native type of `TextBlock &` to `const TextBlock &`.
Yes, we use a cast to add const! So we have two casts: 
one to add const to `*this` (so that our call to `operator[]` will call the `const` version), 
the second to remove the `const` from the `const` `operator[]`'s return value. 
The cast that adds `const` is just forcing a safe conversion 
(from a non-`const` object to a `const` one), 
so we use a `static_cast` for that. 
The one that removes `const` can be accomplished only via a `const_cast`, 
so we don't really have a choice there. 
<br><br>
Even more worth knowing is that trying to do things the other way around 
(avoiding duplication by ~~having the `const` version call the non-`const` version~~)
is **not** something you want to do. 
Remember, a `const` member function promises never to change the logical state of its object, 
but a non-`const` member function makes no such promise. 
If you were to call a non-`const` function from a `const` one, 
you'd run the risk that the object you'd promised not to modify would be changed. 
That's why having a `const` member function call a non-`const` one is wrong: 
the object could be changed. 
In fact, to get the code to compile, you'd have to use a `const_cast` to get rid of the `const` on `*this`,
a clear sign of trouble. 
The reverse calling sequence (the one we used above) is safe: 
the non-`const` member function can do whatever it wants with an object, 
so calling a `const` member function imposes no risk. <br>
That's why a `static_cast` works on `*this` in that case: there's no `const`-related danger. 

### ðŸ“Œ Item 4: Make sure that objects are initialized before they're used

- **Always initialize your objects before you use them** <br>
    For non-member objects of built-in types, you'll need to do this manually: 
    ```
    int x = 0;                               // manual initialization of an int
    const char * text = "A C-style string";  // manual initialization of a pointer
    double d;                                // "initialization" by reading from an input stream
    std::cin >> d; 
    ```
    For almost everything else, the responsibility for initialization falls on constructors. 
    The rule there is simple: make sure that *all constructors initialize everything in the object*. 
    - ***Not** to confuse assignment with initialization**. <br>
        Consider a constructor for a class representing entries in an address book:
        ```
        class PhoneNumber 
        { 
            // ... 
        };
        
        class ABEntry  // Address Book Entry
        {
        public:
            ABEntry(const std::string & name, 
                    const std::string & address, 
                    const std::list<PhoneNumber> & phones)
            {
                // these are all assignments, not initializations
                theName = name; 
                theAddress = address; 
                thePhones = phones;
                numTimesConsulted = 0;
            }
        
        private:
            std::string theName;
            std::string theAddress;
            std::list<PhoneNumber> thePhones;
            int num TimesConsulted;
        };
        ```
        This will yield `ABEntry` objects with the values you expect, but it's still not the best approach. 
        The rules of C++ stipulate that data members of an object are initialized *before* the body of a constructor is entered. 
        Inside the `ABEntry` constructor, `theName`, `theAddress`, and `thePhones` **aren't** being initialized, they're being *assigned*. 
        Initialization took place earlier: when their default constructors were automatically called prior to entering the body of the `ABEntry` constructor. 
        This isn't true for `numTimesConsulted`, because it's a built-in type. 
        For it, there's **no** guarantee it was initialized at all prior to its assignment.
    - *Member initialization list* <br>
        ```
        ABEntry::ABEntry(const std::string & name, 
                         const std::string & address, 
                         const std::list<PhoneNumber> & phones)
                : theName(name), 
                  theAddress(address), 
                  thePhones(phones), 
                  numTimesConsulted(0)
        {
            // the ctor body is now empty
        }
        ```
        This constructor yields the same end result as the one above, but it will often be more efficient. 
        There's no need to do default initialization for class-type objects 
        like `theName`, `theAddress`, and `thePhones` before entering the constructor body. 
        For objects of built-in type like `numTimesConsulted`, 
        there is no difference in cost between initialization and assignment, 
        but for consistency, it's often best to initialize everything via member initialization.
        <br><br>
        Similarly, you can use the member initialization list even when you want to default-construct a data member; 
        just specify nothing as an initialization argument. 
        For example, if `ABEntry` had a constructor taking no parameters, it could be implemented like this:
        ```
        ABEntry::ABEntry()
                : theName(),            // call theName's default ctor;
                  theAddress(),         // do the same for theAddress;
                  thePhones(),          // and for thePhones;
                  numTimesConsulted(0)  // but explicitly initialize numTimesConsulted to zero
        {
        
        } 
        ```

### ðŸ“Œ Item 1: Understand template type deduction

If youâ€™re willing to overlook a pinch of pseudocode, we can think of a function template as looking like this:
```
template <typename T>
void f(ParamType param);

f(expr);  // call f with some expression
```
During compilation, compilers use expr to deduce two types: one for `T` and one for `ParamType`. 
These types are frequently **different**, because `ParamType` often contains adornments, e.g., `const` or reference qualifiers. 
E.g., for the following case, `T` is deduced to be `int`, but `ParamType` is deduced to be `const int &`. 
```
template <typename T>
void f(const T & param);  // ParamType is const T &

int x = 0;
f(x);                     // call f with an int
```
