- Single-input Interval DP: `dp[i][j]` denotes answer for `input[i..j]`. 
  - Transfer patterns: 
    - Shrink/extend either/both side(s)
      - Enumerate length and center
        - [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)
      - Sliding window manner
        - [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)
    - Enumerate length and left side, split in middle
      - Middle split pointss could be alone or part of left interval: 
        - `[i, k) + k + (k, j]`: `i <= k <= j`. 
        - `[i, k] + [k + 1, j]`: `i <= k < j`. 
        - Note **not** all splits are naturally valid for state transfer. 
  - Examples
    - [312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/) (HARD)
      - One-padding of input, Enumerate interval length and left node, split in middle
    - [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/) (MEDIUM)
      - Shrink either side
    - [1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-merge-stones/) (HARD)
      - Special care for initialization and step size for split point (`k`). 
      - **Not** all splits are naturally valid for state transfer. 
- Double-input Interval DP: 
  - `dp[i][j][len]` denotes answer for `s1[i:i+len]` and `s2[j:j+len]`. 
    - [87. Scramble String](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/)
      - Transfer: Split interval in middle...
  - `dp[i][j][...]` denotes answer for `s1[i]` and `s2[j]` with addition status info.
